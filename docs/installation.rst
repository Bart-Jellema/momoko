Installation
============

Momoko is only tested on Python 2.7, but it should run on any Python version
that is supported by `Tornado`_ and `Psycopg2`_. Except Python 3.

Only two dependencies need to be installed: Tornado and Psycopg2. Both  are
hosted on `PyPi`_ and can be installed manually (by downloading the sources),
with *easy_install* or `pip`_.

Momoko itself can also be installed from PyPi with::

   pip install momoko

The latest sources can be cloned from the `Github repository`_ and
installed with::

   python setup.py install
