Momoko also needs to support blocking connections next to asynchronous
connections. All asynchronous classes must be renamed and blocking code has
to be added.

 - Rename `Client` to `AsyncClient`.
 - Rename `Pool` to `AsyncPool`.
 - Add a pool for blocking connections based on the existing asynchronous pool.
   Maybe `SimpleConnectionPool` from the Psycopg2 module can be used:
   http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/pool.html#psycopg2.pool.SimpleConnectionPool
   https://github.com/dvarrazzo/psycopg/blob/devel/lib/pool.py
 - Add a client for the blocking pool.
 - Move pools to pools.py.
 - Move Clients to clients.py
