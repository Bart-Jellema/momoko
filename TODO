A list of things that needs to be done before the 0.3.0 release.

 - Make sure that the behaviour between the callback and blocking style API
   is consistent. Both APIs need to accept the same argument and return the
   same results. Exceptions are allowed when needed.

 - Documentation must be improved. The API documentation must follow the
   following template:

    - One line description.
    - Detailed description.
    - List of arguments.
    - Description of returned results.

   The examples page shows how the API is used with code snippets. The examples
   must also be in the examples directory.
